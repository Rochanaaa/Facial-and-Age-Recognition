# Gender and Age Recognition using Neural Networks

Neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have emerged as powerful tools for image analysis, posing as a tool for gender and age classification.

Develop two models for the purpose of gender classification, namely, Convolutional Neural Networks and EfficientNets using the Adience Dataset. 
Additionally, we were able to build a CNN to support multiclass classification for age. 
We also incorporated several optimization techniques including batch normalisation, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping to enhance the performance of our baseline CNN model. 
We were able to develop a superior model, with increased performance on both Age and Gender classification tasks, fulfilling the objective of this project.
